  <h2>My Story<span class="highlight">.</span></h2>
  <p>
    I am a <strong class="highlight">passionate</strong> web developer with a
    love for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. My journey began in
    senior high school when I started experimenting with HTML and CSS. Since
    then, I have <strong class="highlight">honed</strong> my skills in various
    front-end and back-end technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with others to
    bring ideas to life. In my free time, I love relaxing and sometimes doing
    hobbies.
