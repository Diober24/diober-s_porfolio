          Monitoring of Case Records submitted by other departments. The system
          allows users to track the status of cases, manage documents, and
          communicate with relevant parties. It aims to streamline the complaint
          process and improve efficiency in handling cases.

        Some challenges I faced during the development of the system include
        ensuring data security, integrating with existing databases, and
        providing a user-friendly interface. Another major hurdle was handling
        the full process of filed documents from the moment they're submitted to
        the point they're finalized. This required carefully aligning the
        interface with the underlying database logic to make sure every step of
        the workflow was accurately tracked and stored.

      <p>
        The system successfully streamlined the document filing process,
        reducing manual errors and improving overall efficiency. Executive
        Arbiter found the interface intuitive and easy to navigate, and the
        integration with the database ensured that data remained consistent and
        secure throughout each stage. As a result, the workflow became more
        transparent and traceable, allowing staff to handle documents more
        effectively from submission to completion.
